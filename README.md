# Hello! 👋 I'm [Nikola Selic](https://nikolaselic.com/)

Hello! My name is Nikola Selic. I am a Computer Science Master’s student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), with a strong focus on Natural Language Processing, Federated Learning, Graph Neural Networks, and Causality.

In addition to my studies, I have gained extensive work experience in various roles, including as a Research Assistant at Deutsches Herzzentrum Muenchen, where I implemented multi-camera systems, deployed GDPR-compliant data storage solutions, and optimized NVIDIA environments for real-time applications. Previously, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Amazon Web Services (AWS) in Dresden, where I developed an advanced NLP model, classified security risks, and enhanced security patch identification processes. I also have experience as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Typhoon HIL, Inc. in Serbia, where I contributed to energy consumption simulations and reinforcement learning models.

Please feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating—I would love to connect with you!
